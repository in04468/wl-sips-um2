    <p>You are now connected to the Worldline public Internet Site describing epayment services provided in the UK (“Site") which is operated by Worldline IT Services UK Limited (“Worldline"). Worldline is part of the Atos Group of Companies of which Atos SA, a French Limited Company is the ultimate parent ("Atos Group").</p>
    <p>This policy is effective from 11 August 2016 but may be changed from time to time by updates to this page. Please review this policy on a regular basis to ensure that you are happy with it. If you have any questions on our policy please email us at <a href="mailto:paymentacceptance@worldline.com?subject=Privacy policy query">paymentacceptance@worldline.com</a>. </p>
    <p>This policy describes how we collect and use data in relation to your use of this Site. </p>
    <h2>Data that we will collect</h2>
    <p>When you contact us to discuss the services that are offered by Wordline, by filling in our contact form or talking to us over the phone or in subsequent emails, you will be sharing information which Worldline will collect, which may include Personal Data from which you can be identified (“Data"). </p>
    <p>We will also collect certain data about your computer such as your IP address and use of our Site (e.g. frequency & length of visits, pages visited). </p>
    <h2>Use of your data</h2>
    <p>We respect your privacy and take care in the storage and use of your Data. We collect and process all personal data in accordance with UK data protection legislation currently in force. </p>
    <p>We will use Data that we collect in order to assess your needs and to ensure that you are delivered with the appropriate service by Worldline. </p>
    <p>We also use Data in order to operate the Site from a technical and practical perspective and for our own internal record keeping purposes. </p>
    <p>In addition to the use of your Data as we have described above we may use your Data to send you marketing communications from Worldline and from other Atos Group Companies with respect to our epayment services and other services offered by the Atos Group . You will be given the opportunity to opt out of these communications on the site and / or by contacting us at any time at <a href="mailto:paymentacceptance@worldline.com?subject=Opt out request">paymentacceptance@worldline.com</a>. </p>
    <h2>Overseas Transfers of Data</h2>
    <p>The Atos Group is a global group of companies and accordingly, Data may be processed by Atos Group Companies in any country in which they operate. Some of those countries (for instance the United States) do not have data protection laws in place that are equivalent to those in the UK and your rights in those countries may not be as strong. You expressly consent to those transfers. You may be reassured by the fact that the Atos Group has had its Binding Corporate Rules (BCRs) approved by European data protection authorities both as a data controller and a processor. This approval evidences Worldline’s commitment to the protection not only of its own data but also that of its clients. The BCR are a commitment whereby the companies of the Atos Group undertake to process personal data in accordance with a stringent level of protection to personal data it processes for its own needs (employee data, etc.) but also for the needs of its customers, therefore allowing the free flow of personal data between the companies of the Atos Group. </p>
    <p>Of course, you have the right to request access, amendment or erasure of your Personal Data. To exercise this right, you can contact us at <a href="mailto:paymentacceptance@worldline.com?subject=Personal data request">paymentacceptance@worldline.com</a>. We may make a charge for this. </p>
    <h2>Security</h2>
    <p>Transactions over the internet are not in themselves secure so we cannot guarantee the security of the Data that you provide to us. We will however take reasonable technical and organisational measures to prevent the loss or corruption of your data in accordance with UK data protection legislation. </p>
    <h2>Cookies </h2>
    <p>We also use Cookies on the Site. More information about our use of Cookies can be found on our <a href="#/cookiepolicy">Cookie Policy </a></p>
